## Why This Happened

### Branch Structure

```
GitHub Repository: glitch-peace
│
├── 📁 main branch
│   └── Old code (what you see on main page)
│
└── 📁 copilot/organize-folders-structure branch
    └── ALL NEW UPDATES! ✨
        ├── Mode System Architecture
        ├── Shooter Mode
        ├── Comprehensive README (697 lines)
        ├── Installation Guide
        ├── 12 Research Documents
        ├── Session Summaries
        └── Everything else!
```

**This is normal!** We followed standard development practices:
- Work on feature branch
- Keep main branch stable
- Merge when ready

We just haven't merged yet, so updates are "hidden" on the feature branch.
