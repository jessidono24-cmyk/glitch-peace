# GLITCH·PEACE Gameplay Modes Planning Session
## Transforming Vision into Multidimensional Platform

**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Session Goal**: Plan and document multiple gameplay modes to make the best game possible

---

## Mission Statement

Transform GLITCH·PEACE from a single grid-based tactical game into a comprehensive multidimensional consciousness exploration platform with diverse gameplay modes, story/campaign mode, freeplay mode, and multiplayer capabilities.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Vision Confirmed as "Holy Grail" ✅

**Complete Foundation Saved:**
- 13 comprehensive research documents (~162KB total)
- Complete consciousness engine architecture
- Ethical framework (Sovereign Codex)
- Multidimensional research integration
- Scientific foundations (psychology, neuroscience, embodiment, learning)

#### Created GAMEPLAY_MODES.md (17.3KB)

**6 Gameplay Modes:**
1. **Grid Mode** (EXISTING ✅) - Tactical tile-based movement
2. **Shooter Mode** (NEXT - Priority: HIGH) - Fast-paced action combat
3. **RPG Mode** (Priority: MEDIUM) - Deep narrative with dialogue and quests
4. **Constellation Mode** (Priority: MEDIUM) - Meditative puzzle patterns
5. **Platformer Mode** (Priority: LOW) - Classic side-scrolling
6. **Rhythm Mode** (Priority: LOW) - Music-based gameplay

**5 Game Modes (How You Play):**
1. **Campaign/Story Mode** 🎯 - Guided narrative journey

  constructor() {
    this.currentMode = 'grid';
    this.modes = {
      grid: new GridMode(),
      shooter: new ShooterMode(),
      rpg: new RPGMode(),
      constellation: new ConstellationMode(),
      platformer: new PlatformerMode(),
      rhythm: new RhythmMode()
    };
  }
  
  switchMode(modeName) {
    this.modes[this.currentMode].cleanup();
    this.currentMode = modeName;
    this.modes[modeName].init();
  }
  
  update(dt) {
    this.modes[this.currentMode].update(dt);
  }
  
  render(ctx) {
    this.modes[this.currentMode].render(ctx);
  }
}
```

### Mode Interface
All modes implement:
