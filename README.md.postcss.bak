# GLITCH·PEACE

> A consciousness-awakening tool for learning, healing, and transformation

## Vision

GLITCH·PEACE is more than a game—it's a consciousness engine designed to:

- 🌟 **Awaken consciousness** through meta-awareness and emergence mechanics
- 🌱 **Support addiction cessation** via gentle stress inoculation and pattern recognition
- 📚 **Accelerate learning** in language acquisition and mathematical thinking
- 🧠 **Strengthen intelligence** through IQ (cognitive) and EQ (emotional) development
- 🕉️ **Explore wisdom traditions** from multiple cultures without dogma
- 🔄 **Facilitate transformation** through integrated systems working in harmony

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| WASD / Arrows | Move |
| SHIFT | Toggle Matrix A/B |
| J | Archetype power |
| R | Glitch Pulse |
| Q | Freeze enemies |
| C | Containment zone |
| ESC | Pause |

## Current Status

### ✅ Complete (Phases 1-5)
- **Base game mechanics** - 17 tile types, 10 dreamscapes, 5 archetypes
- **Emotional engine** - 10-emotion field system
- **Temporal system** - Lunar phases, weekday harmonics
- **Pattern recognition** - Impulse buffer, consequence preview
- **Audio engine** - Procedural sounds

**~5,000 lines of code** across 16 source files

### 🏗️ Planned (Phases 6-11)
- **Learning systems** - Language, mathematics, meta-learning
- **Cessation tools** - Session tracking, urge management, habit replacement
- **Awareness features** - Self-reflection, presence training, emergence tracking
- **Intelligence enhancement** - IQ/EQ metrics and development
- **Cosmology integration** - Chakras, Tarot, I-Ching, wisdom traditions
- **Integration dashboard** - Unified tracking and transformation visualization

**Target: 20,000+ lines** for complete vision

### System Documentation
Each system has its own README:
- [Learning Systems](src/systems/learning/README.md)
- [Cessation Tools](src/systems/cessation/README.md)
- [Awareness Features](src/systems/awareness/README.md)

## Design Principles

1. **No shame spirals** - Relapse ≠ failure
2. **Sterilized wisdom** - No dogma, simulation framing only
3. **Player identity stable** - Core self never changes
4. **Accessibility first** - Everyone can play and learn
5. **Hearth always reachable** - Safe space always available
6. **Privacy paramount** - Data stays with player

## Development

### Baby Steps Approach
Every change follows a rigorous process:
1. Plan → 2. Implement → 3. Test → 4. Document → 5. Commit → 6. Verify

See [BABY_STEPS_GUIDE.md](docs/BABY_STEPS_GUIDE.md) for details.
